	<h1> Technology of Drones </h1>
	<p>
	The ICAO classifies unmanned aircraft into two types under Circular 328 AN/190: 
	<ol>
	<li>Autonomous aircraft – currently considered unsuitable for regulation due to legal and liability issues.</li>
	<li>Remotely piloted aircraft – subject to civil regulation under ICAO and under the relevant national aviation authority. </li>
	</ol>
  The typical launch and recovery method function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground. Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted aircraft, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed.
