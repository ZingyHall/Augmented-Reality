	<p> An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone and also referred by several other names, is an aircraft without a human pilot aboard. The flight of UAVs may be controlled either autonomously by onboard computers or by the remote control of a pilot on the ground or in another vehicle. The ICAO classifies unmanned aircraft into two types under Circular 328 AN/190:
	<ul>
		<li>Autonomous aircraft – currently considered unsuitable for regulation due to legal and liability issues</li>
		<li>Remotely piloted aircraft – subject to civil regulation under ICAO and under the relevant national aviation authority.</li>
	</ul>
	The typical launch and recovery method function of an automatic system or an external operator on the ground.[1] Historically, UAVs were simple remotely piloted aircraft, but autonomous control is increasingly being employed.
